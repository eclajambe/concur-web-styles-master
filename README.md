## Tips for converting icons from Ai to Sketch

### First, simplify paths in Ai

1. Simplify paths as much as possible in Ai *before* bringing into Sketch.
⋅⋅1. Expand all strokes (and Unite if necessary)
⋅⋅2. Unite overlapping paths
⋅⋅3. Ensure all paths are knocked out from parent shape that should be
2. Group all paths into one shape
3. Copy (CTRL-C) shape

### Next, past shape into Sketch

1. Paste into Sketch (CTRL-V) 
2. Simplify paths, again
⋅⋅1. Within the shape, ungroup any paths that may be grouped in a folder
⋅⋅2. Delete any masks 
3. Select all paths, then "Union" them
4. Select all paths within shape that are now using "Union" as their combine method.
⋅⋅1. Change combine method to "None"
